When I am having a hard time and feeling very pessimistic I try to think about this idea that I like to call the After-After.

A major traumatic experience happens and suddenly the future seems narrow, constricted. The possibility of happiness feels unreachable. Following the traumatic experience is the After. The After are a handful of imagined possible futures emanating from this painful and confined mental space. These futures are tainted by pessimism and hopelessness and bring little possibility for joy. The After-After is the realm of possibilities that exists beyond this constricted grief-narrowed conception of the future.

My most traumatic experiences have included relationship and friendship breakups, burnouts from work, and then the pandemic. Each time I re-encounter the dreary realm of the After and the dawning wonder of the After-After.

I entered a new role that in many ways came from the After-After. For many years before this role I had prioritized personal growth and fulfillment outside of work. I worried that perhaps I had lost the ability to contribute to more technically demanding roles and would have to accept work that was less inspiring with tools that were not enjoyable to use. In this new job I was going to get to work with Clojure again, learn more about the AI and ML problem domain, and get to work with the technical leader from my role ten years ago (!) in Utah.

This was going to be my first time onboarding into a company with 1000+ employees and multiple distinct software and systems engineering teams. Our team was young, relatively speaking, and the parent IT organization had been around for more than ten years. Technical leadership appeared to be, on the surface, leaning towards a security and privacy-oriented architecture and a conservative philosophy toward systems architecture. This would pose some challenges.

Some great things about this role:

- There was no stigma against folks in less-than full-time roles. I struggled with insecurity about this as a contractor in my previous role.
- Benefits are excellent. I enjoyed the flexibility of being a contractor but having great benefits is really nice.
- I got to work in Clojure again!
- I got a chance to learn much more about Docker and even learn how to maintain and extend an application written using Kubernetes.
- I had the privilege to work with very smart and kind co-workers.
- The company placed an emphasis on continually revisiting a core set of values.
- The company was an LLC. I really like that the mission of the company was not to generate money for shareholders or investors but to actually serve customers and create a great place for employees to work in.
- I realized that I had to start being addressed to using they/them pronouns exclusively and was grateful to discover that the HR team would be able to offer me support if I had any problems with this.

There were some challenges, though:

- There was a feeling that our team had to sometimes rush to contribute value to the company. I felt like sometimes we were spread too thin and that we were prioritizing developing new systems over validating and properly maintaining existing systems. This was likely the right strategy. However, it felt stressful and unsustainable to me.
- I had the expectation that this team would have a strong culture of code reviews. Unfortunately, for the second time in a row, I entered a role where my supervisor had never experienced code review processes. While he agreed that we should adopt this process, there were ongoing challenges getting buy-in and actually implementing this consistently.
- Because of the nature of AI research we had to constantly be learning and evaluating new technologies. It was challenging for me to straddle roles of systems development and systems maintenance while trying to sip from the firehose of latest developments in working with LLMs.
- The team culture was very oriented toward meetings and less so toward updating issue trackers. I thrive in a communications structure that leans more toward asynchronous communications and really struggle when communications are synchronous and primarily verbal.
- The research-and-prototype-driven nature of the team seemed to yield many brainstorming sessions. I can’t function well in brainstorming sessions – I find them very draining. I get quickly fatigued at trying to context-switch between social demands and technical demands of the session and find that I can’t contribute as meaningfully as if I was writing or commenting on a written proposal.
- There was pressure to deliver new features and new products quickly. When we did deliver a product it often required substantial ongoing maintenance. It was challenging to straddle the roles of a researcher, a maintainer, and a developer of new systems.
- The company operated on very privacy-sensitive data. As a result, systems engineering decisions by necessity seemed to be centralized. Additionally, because of the size of the company it was challenging to track down the right people to approve and schedule deployment of new hosting infrastructure. Many of the top decision makers seem to have very full meeting calendars.
- The company is on a growth-oriented path and systems engineers in particular were quite busy. Our team had the know-how necessary to build and deploy full-stack applications but the company-wide development process and limited access to systems engineering resources often prevented us from doing that.

The stresses of this role started to affect my quality of sleep. Days with multiple meetings would leave me fried and unable to enjoy my evenings after work. Trying to develop and steward projects asynchronously in a team oriented toward synchronous decision-making would leave me feeling powerless, unappreciated, and drained. Not consistently having the freedom to develop and deploy our own systems infrastructure was pretty frustrating. I really liked my team members and supervisors but sadly I realized that it was time to let go.
